      "firstReview1": "I had the opportunity to work with Juliana Carvalho at Red Ventures Brazil and Okto Brazil, and always obtained excellent results in her recruitments.",
      "firstReview2": "Juliana is a highly qualified professional, with a great ability to quickly absorb the requirements of each position. Moreover, her skill in understanding the cultural aspects of companies allows her to deliver professionals who are not only technically aligned but also adherent to the organizational culture.",
      "firstReview3": "Her assertiveness and precision in conducting selection processes make her an excellent partner for any company seeking high-level talent.",
      "second.subtitle": "Client Testimonial",
      "secondReview1": "The best investment I made to kickstart taking care of my career. Ju helped me structure my LinkedIn, CV (Portuguese and English), and PDA, and it turned out excellent. I received numerous questions like 'Hey, but you work in R&S, why don't you do it yourself?', after all, I know how to do it and help friends! However, when I tried to do mine, I got stuck and trapped in a structure that didn't favor me. Ju has different experience and knowledge from mine, which made her extremely assertive! I was stagnant in contacts, wasn't receiving messages from recruiters, and wasn't getting responses from jobs I applied to, and when I did, they were negative right at the screening stage.",
      "secondReview2": "I understood that something was wrong, and Ju was excellent in conducting conversations with me, understanding me as a professional, and also exactly what I wanted to achieve and convey with my CV/LinkedIn! I passed some info she asked for, and she changed the entire structure! It became extremely more strategic, conveying exactly what I wanted, and in 1 month with the adjusted profile, I received more than 5 contacts from recruiters interested in chatting, something that wasn't happening before! I'm very happy, I recommend her to everyone who asks me to do it haha because besides doing all this, she was (and is) always available on WhatsApp to guide me and answer questions!",
      "secondReview3": "Excellent professional, competent, and concerned with understanding what you really want to be assertive in delivery! I recommend 100%",
      "third.subtitle": "Client Testimonial",
      "thirdReview1": "Juliana's consultancy was a turning point in my career! I was frustrated with my job search, sending resumes without response and with a LinkedIn profile that didn't reflect my potential. I decided to invest in professional help, and it was the best decision I made. She not only revamped my resume and LinkedIn profile but also helped me identify my main skills and achievements. The process was collaborative and enlightening. Juliana has a keen eye for highlighting points that we often overlook about ourselves.",
      "thirdReview2": "The result was impressive! In just a few weeks, I started receiving interview invitations and messages from recruiters. My response rate to applications increased significantly. More importantly, I felt much more confident in presenting myself professionally. In addition to the excellent work with the documents, she prepared me for interviews, providing valuable tips and constructive feedback. Her personalized approach made all the difference - she really cares about understanding the needs and goals of each client.",
      "thirdReview3": "Thanks to Juliana's consultancy, I got a position I really wanted. Her professionalism, market knowledge, and dedication are exceptional. I recommend her services to anyone who wants to boost their career. It's worth every penny invested!"
